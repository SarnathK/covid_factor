# covid_factor
Covid has had a huge impact on every aspect of human life and it continues to be so even in 2022.
Timeseries modelers often have a tough time modeling covid impact because there is no variable that captures the "strength" of covid.
It keeps changing. Wave after wave. Different waves in different countries and so on.
In this repository, you can find an XL file that creates a "covid_factor" column for 2020 and 2021 that captures the "strength" of covid seen through the impact on Tourism.
This approach is better than tracking covid infections because airline lockdowns and shutdowns happened even before the infection started to rage. So tracking covid infections does not really translate to the "impact" it had on Human endeavors.
So tracking by tourism makes a lot more sense.
